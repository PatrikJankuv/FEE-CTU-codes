<h4>Adam Teicher's pick</h4>
<p>The Seahawks are 0-4 in games against teams that, like the Chiefs, are in the top 10 in scoring. The Seahawks are ninth in scoring but have posted more than 31 points just once, against the lowly 49ers. The Chiefs have been over 31 points eight times and are better equipped to win a shootout, which this game will become. Chiefs 34, Seahawks 27</p>
<h4>Brady Henderson's pick</h4>
<p>The Seahawks' defense had several coverage busts in the first half of their overtime loss to the 49ers in Week 15, showing what a great playcaller like Kyle Shanahan can do against Seattle even without a great cast of skill players. It'll get much harder Sunday against the bright offensive mind of Andy Reid and arguably the NFL's best quarterback/receiver/tight end trio in Patrick Mahomes, Tyreek Hill and Travis Kelce. The Seahawks are a whopping 16-2 in prime-time home games under Pete Carroll, but a dangerous Chiefs offense that leads the league in scoring plus a banged-up Seahawks roster is a bad combination. Chiefs 34, Seahawks 30</p>
